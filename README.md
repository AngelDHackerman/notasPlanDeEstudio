# notasPlanDeEstudio

Aqui guardo el numero de la pagina o el numero de episodo de lo que este estudiando.

## Why this repo?

Here I will save my notes about in what page I'm in or in which episode I leaft the videos that I see when I'm stydding in Platzi about programming. 

This is meant to a proof that **I'm not just leaving code just because I want**, actually I want to show to the world that even **if I not writing code, I'm
learning something about linux. **
